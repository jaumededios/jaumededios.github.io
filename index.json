Given query access to an n-qubit channel E and an observable O, we aim to learn the mapping ρ↦Tr(OE[ρ]) to within a small error for most ρ sampled from a distribution D. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if E is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly nO(log(1/ϵ)), where ϵ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions D invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states ρ. In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution D, provided it is not ``classical'' in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a ``biased Pauli analysis,'' analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting quantum channels over general product distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaume de Dios","José Madrid","Jan Grebík,","Rachel Greenfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1722729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722729600,"objectID":"1feb46d5b1bd010f8091a2dd0c5a5ce0","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/publication/tiling2024/","publishdate":"2024-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tiling2024/","section":"publication","summary":"The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region Σ⊂Rd tiles Rd by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling.

We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets.

Here κ denotes the condition number of the target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory, and (2) a novel reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this problem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.","tags":[],"title":"Query lower bounds for log-concave sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaume de Dios","Helge Jørgen Samuelsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1679529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679529600,"objectID":"9deecf122df253cf47980c3b56599f3d","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/publication/fourierfrequency2023/","publishdate":"2023-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fourierfrequency2023/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate over the class of simple curves where the last coordinate function can be extended to a holomorphic function of bounded frequency in a sufficiently large disc.

These surfaces are the image of complex polynomial curves, equipped with the complex equivalent to the affine arclength measure. This result is a complex-polynomial counterpart to a previous result by Stovall [Sto16] in the real setting. As a means to prove this theorem we provide an alternative proof of a geometric inequality by Dendrinos and Wright [DW10] that extends the result to complex polynomials.","tags":[],"title":"A geometric lemma for complex polynomial curves with applications in Fourier restriction theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jane Carlen","Jaume de Dios","Cassidy Mentus","Shyr-Shea Chang","Stephanie Wang","Mason A.

In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks.","tags":[],"title":"Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic Block Models","type":"publication"}]
