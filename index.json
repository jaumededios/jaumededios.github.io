We reduce studying l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to [0,1]. Our ideas are inspired by the recent work on ellipsephic sets by Biggs using nested efficient congruencing.","tags":["Decoupling"],"title":"Decoupling for fractal subsets of the parabola","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lectures taught by Suzuki Fumiaki.

The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.","tags":["Past"],"title":"On Sparsity in Overparametrised Shallow ReLU Networks ","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lectures taught by Peter Spaas.

In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks..","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic Block Models","type":"publication"}]
