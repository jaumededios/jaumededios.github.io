We reduce studying l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to [0,1].

As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.\n","date":1607360400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607360400,"objectID":"86521ac1aeececba9aadfcc628985e88","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/yaml/md_talk/oars201207/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T17:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yaml/md_talk/oars201207/","section":"Yaml","summary":"Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve.","tags":["Talk","Past"],"title":"Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves","type":"Yaml"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607360400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607360400,"objectID":"9bfc79a4dc8f8f9eeca2a4794d668e9c","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/yaml/old_talk/20201207-oars/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yaml/old_talk/20201207-oars/","section":"Yaml","summary":"","tags":["Past","Talk"],"title":"Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves","type":"Yaml"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604934000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604934000,"objectID":"862497e9b1c3645445bd434f4a5eb3d3","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/talk/ubuab201109/","publishdate":"2019-11-09T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ubuab201109/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Talk","Past"],"title":"Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604934000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604934000,"objectID":"a50bdbe7c78a3666be77295471007e2b","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/yaml/md_talk/ubuab201109/","publishdate":"2019-11-09T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yaml/md_talk/ubuab201109/","section":"Yaml","summary":"","tags":["Talk","Past"],"title":"Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves","type":"Yaml"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604934000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604934000,"objectID":"fb3072a022658ea1fea302a731237859","permalink":"http://jaume.dedios.cat/yaml/old_talk/20201109-ubuab/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yaml/old_talk/20201109-ubuab/","section":"Yaml","summary":"","tags":["Past","Talk"],"title":"Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves","type":"Yaml"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Decoupling estimates were introduced by Wolff [1] in order to improve local smoothing estimates for the wave equation.

In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks..","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic Block Models","type":"publication"}]
