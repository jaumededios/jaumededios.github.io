      "abstract": "We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. Given query access to an n-qubit channel E and an observable O, we aim to learn the mapping ρ↦Tr(OE[ρ]) to within a small error for most ρ sampled from a distribution D. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if E is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly nO(log(1/ϵ)), where ϵ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions D invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states ρ. In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution D, provided it is not ``classical'' in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a ``biased Pauli analysis,'' analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.",

      "date": "2024",
      "abstract": "The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region Σ⊂Rd tiles Rd by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in R, and recently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in R2 whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces.",

      "abstract": "Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent years, but the corresponding problem of proving lower bounds for this task has remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only in dimension one. In this work, we establish the following query lower bounds: (1) sampling from strongly log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension d≥2 requires Ω(logκ) queries, which is sharp in any constant dimension, and (2) sampling from Gaussians in dimension d (hence also from general log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension d) requires Ω˜(min(κ√logd,d)) queries, which is nearly sharp for the class of Gaussians. Here κ denotes the condition number of the target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory, and (2) a novel reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this problem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.",

We reduce studying l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to [0,1]. Our ideas are inspired by the recent work on ellipsephic sets by Biggs using nested efficient congruencing.",

      "abstract": "Urban spatial networks are complex systems with interdependent roles of neighborhoods and methods of transportation between them. In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has direct application to the design and maintece of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks.",

      "abstract": "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.",

      "abstract": "A common way to generate samples from random variables is through diffusion processes. For instance, to obtain a uniformly sampled point on a given set, we run a random walk on the set for a long enough time. For non-uniform random variables, we run the appropriate Langevin dynamics. In practice, this raises a basic worst-case question: where can you start so that mixing (exploration) of the random walk is as slow or \"unlucky\" as possible? Which initial regions are particularly bad? This question was classically posed by mathematical physicists, in the language of heat flow, as the \"Hot Spots\" Conjecture. Informally, it predicts that the most extreme behavior should occur at the boundary. The conjecture sits at an intersection of diffusion processes and high-dimensional geometry, and has been understood as a stepping stone toward conjectures such as Kannan-Lovász-Simonovits (KLS). But the Hot Spots Conjecture is false, even for convex sets. In this talk, I'll reinterpret it through a diffusion/sampling lens and explain what its failure really means for algorithms.",

Però què passa per a variables aleatòries generals en dimensions molt altes? Com a exemple, podem intentar generar un element de la distribució de possibles fotografies de gats. Les imatges de 512px × 512px (×3 colors) són elements d'un espai de gairebé un milió de dimensions.

      "abstract": "Decoupling and discrete restriction inequalities have been very fruitful in recent years to solve problems in additive combinatorics and analytic number theory. In this talk I will present some work in decoupling for Cantor sets, including Cantor sets on a parabola, decoupling for product sets, and give applications of these results to additive combinatorics. Time permitting, I will present some open problems. Based on joint work with Alan Chang, Rachel Greenfeld, Asgar Jamneshan, José Madrid, Zane Li and Paata Ivanisvili",

      "abstract": "Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.",

      "abstract": "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.",
