  event:    Uniform boundedness in operators parametrized by polynomial curves
  event_url: "https://sites.google.com/view/paw-seminar"
  abstract: "Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction
theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly
on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite
number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case,
multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In
this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial.
In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new
decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some
applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis."

  title: "Decoupling for Cantor Sets"
  type: Workshop
  event:  Fourier restriction online 2021
  event_url: " https://sites.google.com/view/restriction2021/"
  abstract: "In this talk we discuss sharp ℓ2L2n estimates for Cantor sets. These estimates
             are related to the work of Biggs bounding the number of solutions to a certain
             type of Diophantine equations for integers contained in Ellipsephic sets, sets
             of numbers missing certain digits in base p. We discuss the connection between
             both problems, and exploit it to find computational methods to find sharp
             decoupling estimates. Joint work with A. Chang, R. Greenfeld, A. Jamneshan, Z.K.
             Li and J. Madrid."

  title: "Decoupling and applications: from PDEs to Number Theory."
  type: Seminar
  event: SIMBa seminar (UB / BGSMATH)
  event_url: http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/
  abstract: "Decoupling estimates were introduced by Wolff [1] in order to improve local
              smoothing estimates for the wave equation. Since then, they have found
              multiple applications in analysis: from PDEs and restriction theory, to
              additive number theory, where Bourgain, Demeter and Guth[2] used decoupling-type
              estimates to prove the main conjecture of the Vinogradov mean value theorem for
              d>3.

              In this talk I will explain what decoupling estimates are, I will talk about its
              applications to the Vinogradov Mean Value theorem and local smoothing, and I
              will explain the main ingredients that go into (most) decoupling proofs

  title: On Sparsity in Overparametrised Shallow ReLU Networks
  type: Seminar
  event: NYU, MaD Group Meeting 
  abstract: "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime
             remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a 
             single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an
             appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key
             challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron
             setting, where practical algorithms operate.
             Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in
             this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies
             to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on
             the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of
             implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets
             [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17],
             compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the
             activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that
             both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of
             neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the
             consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of
             regularisation is favorable over the other."
