  abstract: "We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. 
            Given query access to an n-qubit channel E and an observable O, we aim to learn the mapping ρ↦Tr(OE[ρ])
            to within a small error for most ρ sampled from a distribution D. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill 
            proved a surprising result that even if E is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly nO(log(1/ϵ)), 
            where ϵ is the target prediction error. 

            However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions D invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, 
            and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states ρ.
            In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product 
            distribution D, provided it is not ``classical'' in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. 

            Our method employs a ``biased Pauli analysis,'' analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing 
            this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a 
            basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have 
            broader applications in quantum information."

  arxiv: "arXiv:2408.02151"
  url : "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02151"
  date: "2024-08-04"
  abstract: "The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region Σ⊂Rd tiles Rd by translations then it admits at 
             least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in R, and recently it was disproved in 
             sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: 
             bounded open sets in R2 whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. 
             We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. 
             As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. 
             Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., 
             can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces."

  title : "Query lower bounds for log-concave sampling"
  type: Preprint
  arxiv: "arXiv:2304.02599 "
  url : "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02599"
  date: "2023-04-05"
  abstract: "Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent years, but the corresponding 
             problem of proving lower bounds for this task has remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only 
             in dimension one. 
             In this work, we establish the following query lower bounds: (1) sampling from strongly log-concave and 
             log-smooth distributions in dimension d≥2 requires Ω(logκ) queries, which is sharp in any constant dimension, 
             and (2) sampling from Gaussians in dimension d (hence also from general log-concave and log-smooth 
             distributions in dimension d) requires Ω˜(min(κ√logd,d)) queries, which is nearly sharp for the class of 
             Gaussians. Here κ denotes the condition number of the target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a 
             multiscale construction inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory, and (2) a 
             novel reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this problem, as well as 
             connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature."

             the $k-$higher energy of $A$ (i.e., the number of $2k-$tuples $(a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_{2k})$ in $A^{2k}$

             $|A|^{\log_2{ \\binom{2k}{k}}}$, and $\\log_2{ \\binom{2k}{k}}$ is the best possible exponent. We discuss 
             the analogous problems for the sets ${0,1,\dots,n}^d$ for $n\geq2$."

  abstract: "In this paper we study an autocorrelation inequality proposed by Barnard and Steinerberger. The 
             study of these problems is motivated by a classical problem in additive combinatorics. We 
             establish the existence of extremizers to this inequality, for a general class of weights, 
             including Gaussian functions (as studied by the second author and Ramos) and characteristic 
             function (as originally studied by Barnard and Steinerberger). Moreover, via a discretization 
             argument and numerical analysis, we find some almost optimal approximation for the best constant 
             allowed in this inequality. We also discuss some other related problem about autoconvolutions."

  date: "2020-12-21"
  abstract: "We consider decoupling for a fractal subset of the parabola. We reduce studying
             l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying 
             l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This 
             generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the 
             parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to 
             improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case
             when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to 
             explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to 
             [0,1]. Our ideas are inspired by the recent work on ellipsephic sets by Biggs 
             using nested efficient congruencing."

  abstract: "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime
             remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single 
             hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route 
             forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring 
             learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms 
             operate.
             Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work
             we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions 
             requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. 
             Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by 
             injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the 
             variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. 
             Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with 
             ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a 
             finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. 
             We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one 
             form of regularisation is favorable over the other."

  abstract: "Urban spatial networks are complex systems with interdependent roles of 
             neighborhoods and methods of transportation between them. In this paper, we 
             classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the 
             spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility 
             dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with 
             degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which
             (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe
             the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our 
             models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in
             urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they 
             also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we 
             look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as 
             leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent 
             SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are 
             influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has 
             direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and
             it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer 
             networks."
