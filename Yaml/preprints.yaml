  abstract: "In this paper we study an autocorrelation inequality proposed by Barnard and Steinerberger. The 
             study of these problems is motivated by a classical problem in additive combinatorics. We 
             establish the existence of extremizers to this inequality, for a general class of weights, 
             including Gaussian functions (as studied by the second author and Ramos) and characteristic 
             function (as originally studied by Barnard and Steinerberger). Moreover, via a discretization 
             argument and numerical analysis, we find some almost optimal approximation for the best constant 
             allowed in this inequality. We also discuss some other related problem about autoconvolutions."

  title : "A geometric lemma for complex polynomial curves with applications in Fourier restriction theory"

  date: "2020-03-31"
  abstract: "The aim of this paper is to prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate for certain 2−dimensional
             surfaces in R<sup>2n</sup>. These surfaces are the image of complex polynomial curves, equipped 
             with the complex equivalent to the affine arclength measure. This result is a complex-polynomial 
             counterpart to a previous result by Stovall [Sto16] in the real setting. As a means to prove this 
             theorem we provide an alternative proof of a geometric inequality by Dendrinos and Wright [DW10] 
             that extends the result to complex polynomials."

  title : "Decoupling for fractal subsets of the parabola"
  type: Preprint

  url : "https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11458"
  date: "2020-12-21"
  abstract: "We consider decoupling for a fractal subset of the parabola. We reduce studying
             l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying 
             l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This 
             generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the 
             parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to 
             improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case
             when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to 
             explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to 
             [0,1]. Our ideas are inspired by the recent work on ellipsephic sets by Biggs 
             using nested efficient congruencing."

  abstract: "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime
             remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single 
             hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route 
             forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring 
             learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms 
             operate.
             Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work
             we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions 
             requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. 
             Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by 
             injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the 
             variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. 
             Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with 
             ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a 
             finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. 
             We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one 
             form of regularisation is favorable over the other."

  abstract: "Urban spatial networks are complex systems with interdependent roles of 
             neighborhoods and methods of transportation between them. In this paper, we 
             classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the 
             spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility 
             dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with 
             degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which
             (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe
             the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our 
             models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in
             urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they 
             also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we 
             look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as 
             leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent 
             SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are 
             influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has 
             direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and
             it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer 
             networks."
