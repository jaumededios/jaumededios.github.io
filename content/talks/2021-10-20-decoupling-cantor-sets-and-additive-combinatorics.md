### Abstract

Decoupling and discrete restriction inequalities have been very fruitful in recent years to solve problems in additive combinatorics and analytic number theory. In this talk I will present some work in decoupling for Cantor sets, including Cantor sets on a parabola, decoupling for product sets, and give applications of these results to additive combinatorics. Time permitting, I will present some open problems. Based on joint work with Alan Chang, Rachel Greenfeld, Asgar Jamneshan, José Madrid, Zane Li and Paata Ivanisvili.
