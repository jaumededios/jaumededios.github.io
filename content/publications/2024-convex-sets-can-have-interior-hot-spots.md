## Abstract

The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain Ω in R^d, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in Ω attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct counterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of d. The construction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to log-concave measures.
