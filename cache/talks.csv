"Worst-case starts for diffusion processes: The hot spots conjecture","Seminar","NYU CDS MaD Seminar","2026-02-11","https://cds.nyu.edu/mad/","A common way to generate samples from random variables is through diffusion processes. For instance, to obtain a uniformly sampled point on a given set, we run a random walk on the set for a long enough time. For non-uniform random variables, we run the appropriate Langevin dynamics. In practice, this raises a basic worst-case question: where can you start so that mixing (exploration) of the random walk is as slow or ""unlucky"" as possible? Which initial regions are particularly bad? This question was classically posed by mathematical physicists, in the language of heat flow, as the ""Hot Spots"" Conjecture. Informally, it predicts that the most extreme behavior should occur at the boundary. The conjecture sits at an intersection of diffusion processes and high-dimensional geometry, and has been understood as a stepping stone toward conjectures such as Kannan-Lovász-Simonovits (KLS). But the Hot Spots Conjecture is false, even for convex sets. In this talk, I'll reinterpret it through a diffusion/sampling lens and explain what its failure really means for algorithms.","The Hot Spots Conjecture","research","NYU CDS"

"Convex sets can have interior hot spots","Seminar","Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas (ICMAT) Seminar","2025-09-01","","A homogeneous, insulated object with a non-uniform initial temperature will eventually reach thermal equilibrium. The Hot Spots conjecture addresses which point in the object takes the longest to reach this equilibrium: Where is the maximum temperature attained as time progresses? Rauch initially conjectured that points attaining the maximum temperature would approach the boundary for larger times. Burdzy and Werner disproved the conjecture for planar domains with holes. Kawohl, and later Banuelos- Burdzy, conjectured that the conjecture should still hold for convex sets of all dimensions. This talk will draw inspiration from a recurrent theme in convex anal- ysis: almost every dimension-free result in convex analysis has a natural log-concave extension. We will motivate and construct the log-concave ana- log of the Hot Spots conjecture, and then disprove it. Using this log-concave construction, we will show that the hot spots conjecture for convex sets is false in high dimensions.","The Hot Spots Conjecture","research","ICMAT, Madrid"

Com generem, en un ordinador, variables aleatòries? Per a algunes variables aleatòries molt concretes (gaussianes, distribucions uniformes...) tenim fórmules per a generar-les eficientment. Però què passa per a variables aleatòries generals en dimensions molt altes? Com a exemple, podem intentar generar un element de la distribució de possibles fotografies de gats. Les imatges de 512px × 512px (×3 colors) són elements d'un espai de gairebé un milió de dimensions. En aquest curs aprendrem alguns dels algorismes més coneguts per a generar variables aleatòries, i veurem la relació d'aquests mètodes amb desigualtats funcionals, teoria espectral, i equacions en derivades parcials.","Minicourse","","Valencia"

"Uniformity for polynomial curves","Seminar","Rutgers University Analysis Seminar","2023-10-01","","Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable  interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.","Decoupling & additive combinatorics","research","Rutgers"

"A Function Space Perspective for Regularised and Overparametrised Shallow ReLU Networks","Seminar","NYU, MaD Group Meeting","2020-10-19","","The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.","Sparsity in ReLU Networks","research","NYU"
"Uniform boundedness for certain operators parametrized by polynomial curves","Seminar","Seminari d'Anàlisi UB-UAB","2020-11-09","","Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable  interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.","Uniform boundedness (polynomial curves)","research","UB-UAB, Barcelona"
"Decoupling and applications: from PDEs to Number Theory","Seminar","SIMBa Seminar (UB / BGSMATH)","2020-10-21","http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/","Decoupling estimates were introduced by Wolff [1] in order to improve local smoothing estimates for the wave equation. Since then, they have found multiple applications in analysis: from PDEs and restriction theory, to additive number theory, where Bourgain, Demeter and Guth[2] used decoupling-type estimates to prove the main conjecture of the Vinogradov mean value theorem for d>3.
In this talk I will explain what decoupling estimates are, I will talk about its applications to the Vinogradov Mean Value theorem and local smoothing, and I will explain the main ingredients that go into (most) decoupling proofs
