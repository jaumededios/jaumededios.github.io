"Convex sets can have interior hot spots","Jaume de Dios Pont","arXiv:2412.06344","https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06344","2024","The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$ attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct counterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of $d$. The construction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to log-concave measures.","Preprint"
"Predicting quantum channels over general product distributions","Sitan Chen; Jaume de Dios Pont; Jun-Ting Hsieh; Hsin-Yuan Huang; Jane Lange; Jerry Li","arXiv:2409.03684","https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03684","2024","We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. Given query access to an n-qubit channel E and an observable O, we aim to learn the mapping ρ↦Tr(OE[ρ]) to within a small error for most ρ sampled from a distribution D. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if E is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly nO(log(1/ϵ)), where ϵ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions D invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states ρ. In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution D, provided it is not ``classical'' in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a ``biased Pauli analysis,'' analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.","Preprint"
"Periodicity and decidability of translational tilings by rational polygonal sets","Jaume de Dios Pont; Jan Grebik; Rachel Greenfeld; Jose Madrid","arXiv:2408.02151","https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02151","2024","The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region Σ⊂Rd tiles Rd by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in R, and recently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in R2 whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces.","Expositiones Mathematicae"
"A new proof of the convex hull of space curves with totally positive torsion","Jaume de Dios Pont; Paata Ivanisvili; Jose Madrid","arXiv:2201.12932","https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12932","2024","We give new proofs of the description convex hulls of space curves $\gamma : [a,b] \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d}$ having totally positive torsion. These are curves such that all the leading principal minors of $d\times d$ matrix $(\gamma', \gamma'', \ldots, \gamma^{(d)})$ are positive. In particular, we recover parametric representation of the boundary of the convex hull, different formulas for its surface area and the volume of the convex hull, and the solution to a general moment problem corresponding to $\gamma$.","Michigan Mathematical Journal"
"Query lower bounds for log-concave sampling","Sinho Chewi; Jaume de Dios Pont; Jerry Li; Chen Lu; Shyam Narayanan","arXiv:2304.02599","https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02599","2023","Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent years, but the corresponding problem of proving lower bounds for this task has remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only in dimension one. In this work, we establish the following query lower bounds: (1) sampling from strongly log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension d≥2 requires Ω(logκ) queries, which is sharp in any constant dimension, and (2) sampling from Gaussians in dimension d (hence also from general log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension d) requires Ω˜(min(κ√logd,d)) queries, which is nearly sharp for the class of Gaussians. Here κ denotes the condition number of the target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory, and (2) a novel reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this problem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.","JACM Vol.71 Issue 4 / FOCS 2023"

"Additive energies on discrete cubes","Jaume de Dios Pont; Rachel Greenfeld; Paata Ivanisvili; Jose Madrid","arXiv:2112.09352","https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09352","2023","We prove that for $d\geq 0$ and $k\geq 2$, for any subset $A$ of a discrete cube ${0,1}^d$, the $k-$higher energy of $A$ (i.e., the number of $2k-$tuples $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{2k})$ in $A^{2k}$ with $a_1-a_2=a_3-a_4=\dots=a_{2k-1}-a_{2k}$) is at most $|A|^{\log_{2}(2^k+2)}$, and $\log_{2}(2^k+2)$ is the best possible exponent. We also show that if $d\geq 0$ and $2\leq k\leq 10$, for any subset $A$ of a discrete cube ${0,1}^d$, the $k-$additive energy of $A$ (i.e., the number of $2k-$tuples $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{2k})$ in $A^{2k}$ with $a_1+a_2+\dots+a_k=a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+\dots+a_{2k}$) is at most $|A|^{\log_2{ \binom{2k}{k}}}$, and $\log_2{ \binom{2k}{k}}$ is the best possible exponent. We discuss the analogous problems for the sets ${0,1,\dots,n}^d$ for $n\geq2$.","Discrete Analysis"
"Decoupling for fractal subsets of the parabola","Alan Chang; Jaume de Dios Pont; Rachel Greenfeld; Asgar Jamneshan; Zane Kun Li; Jose Madrid","arXiv:2012.11458","https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11458","2022","We consider decoupling for a fractal subset of the parabola. We reduce studying l2Lp decoupling for a fractal subset on the parabola {(t,t2):0≤t≤1} to studying l2Lp/3 decoupling for the projection of this subset to the interval [0,1]. This generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case when p/3 is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to [0,1]. Our ideas are inspired by the recent work on ellipsephic sets by Biggs using nested efficient congruencing.","Mathematische Zeitschrift"
"Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic Block Models","Jane Carlen; Jaume de Dios Pont; Cassidy Mentus; Shyr-Shea Chang; Stephanie Wang; Mason A. Porter","arXiv:1908.09440","https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09440","2022","Urban spatial networks are complex systems with interdependent roles of neighborhoods and methods of transportation between them. In this paper, we classify docking stations in bicycle-sharing networks to gain insight into the spatial delineations of three major United States cities from human mobility dynamics. We propose novel timedependent stochastic block models, with degree-heterogeneous blocks and either mixed or discrete block membership, which (1) detect the roles served by bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models produce concise descriptions of daily bicycle-sharing usage patterns in urban environments. They successfully uncover work and home districts, and they also reveal dynamics of such districts that are particular to each city. When we look for more than two roles, we uncover blocks with expected uses, such as leisure activity, as well as previously unknown structures. Our time-dependent SBMs also reveal how the functional roles of bicycle-sharing stations are influenced by surrounding public transportation infrastructure. Our work has direct application to the design and maintece of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks.","Network Science"
"On classical inequalities for autocorrelations and autoconvolutions","Jaume de Dios Pont; Jose Madrid","arXiv:2106.13873","https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13873","2021","In this paper we study an autocorrelation inequality proposed by Barnard and Steinerberger. The study of these problems is motivated by a classical problem in additive combinatorics. We establish the existence of extremizers to this inequality, for a general class of weights, including Gaussian functions (as studied by the second author and Ramos) and characteristic function (as originally studied by Barnard and Steinerberger). Moreover, via a discretization argument and numerical analysis, we find some almost optimal approximation for the best constant allowed in this inequality. We also discuss some other related problem about autoconvolutions.","Preprint"
"On Sparsity in Overparametrised Shallow ReLU Networks","Joan Bruna; Jaume de Dios Pont","arXiv:2006.10225","https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10225","2020","The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.","Preprint"
"A geometric lemma for complex polynomial curves in Fourier restriction theory","Jaume de Dios Pont","arXiv:2003.14140","https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14140","2020","The aim of this paper is to prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate for certain 2−dimensional surfaces in R2n. These surfaces are the image of complex polynomial curves, equipped with the complex equivalent to the affine arclength measure. This result is a complex-polynomial counterpart to a previous result by Stovall [Sto16] in the real setting. As a means to prove this theorem we provide an alternative proof of a geometric inequality by Dendrinos and Wright [DW10] that extends the result to complex polynomials.","Preprint"
